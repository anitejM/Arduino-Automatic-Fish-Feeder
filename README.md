# Arduino-Automatic-Fish-Feeder
As part of my 2nd year Internet of Things course, I was required to create a working model using IoT devices, and I chose to make a simple Automatic Fish Feeder using Arduino and sensors. In this repository I have put the report I prepared with my teammate, hardware description and the code for the microcontroller.
